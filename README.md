### Project Details

In this project, I: 
- used OpenCV's implementation to detect human faces in images;
- obtained and implemented a pre-trained model (VGG16);
- created a CNN from scratch to improve results from pre-trained model;
- used data loaders to transform images; and
- trained, validated and tested model.
